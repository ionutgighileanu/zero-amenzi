# DESIGN.md — UI rules for this project. Read before touching any UI.

Reference: a clean Romanian vehicle document and the blue RO plate strip —
official, legible, nothing decorative. Closer to a well-set government form
than to a SaaS landing page. *(This is the one line most worth confirming or
swapping — the rest of the doc follows from it.)*
Tone in three words: calm, precise, reassuring.
Audience: Romanian drivers and small-fleet managers who land worried they may
have missed an ITP / RCA / rovinietă deadline. They want a plain yes/no about
their car, in seconds, without reading a manual.

## Process

1. Before writing any UI code, output a design brief: the palette as
   named tokens with hex values, the two typefaces and why, the layout
   idea in two sentences, the one motion idea, and how the reference
   shows up. Wait for my approval. Do not build from an unapproved brief.
2. Build the whole page from that brief. If you drift from it, say so.
3. When done, run the self-review at the bottom and fix what it finds
   before showing me.

## Banned. Never, without me asking by name.

- Slate-900 or any near-black blue-gray page background.
- Radial gradient blobs, blurred glows, or "orbs" as backgrounds.
- Gradient text. Purple-to-pink, blue-to-cyan, any of it.
- Purple as a primary accent. If the brief needs purple, justify it.
- Icons inside rounded-square or circular badges. Icons in feature lists
  at all, unless the icon carries meaning a word cannot.
- Three-column feature grids with icon, title, two lines of copy.
- Bento grids, unless every cell shows real data from this product.
- Fake charts, fake sparklines, fake toggles, fake cursors, fake
  dashboards. If it isn't real, it doesn't ship.
- Tilted or 3D-perspective screenshots. Screenshots are flat, at 1x,
  and real.
- Drop shadows with a blur over 24px. Glowing borders. Border-beam
  effects.
- A taller, glowing, or "Most Popular" pricing card. All tiers equal;
  recommend with copy, not with height.
- Testimonials, logo bars, star ratings, or "Trusted by N" counts that
  are not literally true with named, real sources. No proof beats fake
  proof.
- Stock photos of people. No Unsplash headshots, ever.
- Pills above the headline. "Now with AI." "New." Sparkle emoji.
- Emoji anywhere in UI text.
- The words: supercharge, seamless, effortless, unlock, elevate,
  empower, revolutionize, next-generation, AI-powered, all-in-one,
  game-changing, unleash. Any headline that could sit on a
  competitor's site unchanged. In Romanian, the same ban covers:
  revoluționar, fără efort, de ultimă generație, totul-într-un-loc.
- Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, or the system font as the display face.
  Fine for body. Never for the words people read first.
- Bouncing, pulsing, or looping animations that exist to look alive.
- Marquees of anything.
- Rounded-2xl on everything. Pick one radius and mean it.

## Required

- One background color, one ink color, one accent. Tokens named for
  their job (bg, ink, accent), never Tailwind palette names. For this
  project they are fixed, already in `src/app/globals.css`:
  - `bg` — `#ffffff` (sections may sit on off-white `#f8fafc`; that is
    the only second surface, not a third color).
  - `ink` — `#171717` (near-black neutral, never a blue-gray).
  - `accent` — `#003399`, the RO plate blue. One accent, used for the
    primary action and nothing decorative.
  - The document semaphore (emerald `valid` / amber `≤15 zile` / red
    `expirat`) is a separate FUNCTIONAL scale, not an accent. It only
    ever encodes real document status. Never borrow it for decoration.
- Two typefaces max, already wired: **Archivo** (800/900) as the display
  face — it has a grotesque, official point of view that fits the
  reference — and **Inter** as the body face, set at 17 to 19px. Real
  type scale: the hero is 4 to 6 times body size, tight tracking on
  display, 1.5 to 1.7 line height on body. Use the `font-display` class
  for display; body is the default.
- One radius: `0.75rem` (`rounded-xl`), used consistently. Where older
  components drift to `rounded-2xl`/`rounded-lg`, converge them, don't
  spread the drift.
- Whitespace is a feature. Sections breathe. Nothing is fighting for
  attention because only one thing on each screen deserves it.
- Asymmetry somewhere. A pulled-left headline, an offset image, a
  column that is narrower than the others on purpose.
- The headline names what the product does for whom, in words the
  customer would use. Specific beats clever. Write UI copy in Romanian,
  plain and direct — the way someone warns a friend their ITP expires
  next week.
- Every number on the page is true. Pricing is 12 lei/an per vehicul.
  Every quote has a real name and a real company. Otherwise the section
  does not exist.
- Motion: one idea, used consistently — ease-out entrance when content
  arrives, under 400ms. Nothing loops. Nothing moves unless the user did
  something or the content just arrived. Respect
  `prefers-reduced-motion` (already honored globally in `globals.css`).
- Screenshots and product imagery are real captures from this product,
  flat, with a 1px border or no border.
- Buttons look like buttons: one primary (`accent`), one secondary
  (outline), no gradients.
- Mobile is designed, not squeezed. Check it at 390px before showing me.

## Self-review before showing me

Go through the page and list every element that:
1. Appears on the banned list.
2. Could be deleted with zero loss of information.
3. Would look at home on a generic SaaS template.
4. Contains a claim you cannot prove.
5. Uses a color, radius, or shadow not in the brief.
Fix all of it, then show me the page and the list of what you changed.
